## `Doggo Mart`


This is a fully functional ecommerce site deployed on Github Pages. Check it out live [here](https://www.imvickywong.com/Doggo_Mart/).

Built using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, BootStrap

I was able to learn React Hooks while having ton of fun creating this project. :)

## `Install`

```
$ npm install
$ npm install -g json-server
```
JSON Server seems to work only if installed as a global package. 

### `Starting the Server`

```
$ json-server public/db.json --port 8000
```
